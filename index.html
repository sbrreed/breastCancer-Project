                    The financial impacts associated with breast cancer, and other cancers alike, effect all patients but are especially impactful
                    on the lower middle class. They are a portion of the population who earn too much to be covered by medicaid
                    but don't earn enough to have the savings necessary to weather the costs and financial losses associated
                    with a drawn out treatment regimen. With heath insurance tied to their jobs, a job loss during treatment-
                    either related to the illness or simply bad timing- can cause a financial spiral into bankruptcy.

                <p class="articleText">
                    Even with insurance intact, the additional costs associated with being sick, such as over the counter medication, wigs, etc.,
                    coupled with lost wages from having to take time off for treatment and rest, can quickly deplete a family's
                    meager savings to zero.

                        her treatment. While the bottom line indicates that she's only responsible for $17.65, were her husband

                        The skyrocketing costs of pharmaceuticals are a major culprit in the financial burden to the patient. Cancer pharmaceuticals
                        are getting steadily more expensive but the improvements in life expectancy are not nearly keeping
                        pace. In a study of 71 drugs to treat solid tumors the median improvement in progression free survival
                        was just 2.3 months. Pharmaceutical companies claim that they need the extra income for R&D yet regularly
                        pocket double digit profits greater than the finance industry. The money they do reinvest in the
                        company usually ends up more in marketing budgets than R&D budgets. Pharmacuetical companies, instead,
                        rely on government funding for R&D.

                        The fear and stress associated with the financial impacts of the disease affect nearly all patients. Stress is well known
                        to inhibit healing. Employer tied health insurance coupled with skyrocketing costs of medicine lead
                        to a toxic financial situation for patients and their families.

                        be inextricably linked to the need for health insurance. As long as the ever increasing costs of
                        pharmaceuticals are passed onto the insurance consumer, Karina and Tom will not likely be able to
                        afford insurance on the private market. </p>
