                    The financial impacts associated with breast cancer, and other cancers alike, effect all patients but are especially impactful
                    on the lower middle class. They are a portion of the population who earn to much to be covered by medicaid
                    but don't earn enough to have the savings necessary to weather the costs and financial losses associated
                    with a drawn out treatment regimen. With heath insurance tied to their jobs, a job loss during treatment-
                    either related to the illness or simply bad timing- can cause a financial spiral into bankruptcy.
                </p>
                <p class="articleText">
                    Even with insurance intact, the additional costs associated with being sick, such as over the counter medication, wigs, etc.,
                    coupled with lost wages from having to take time off for treatment and rest, can quickly deplete a family's
                    meager savings to zero.

                        <img src='media/chemoBill-small.png' class='chemoBill'> The skyrocketing costs of pharmaceuticals are a major culprit in the financial burden to the patient.
                        Cancer pharmaceuticals are getting steadily more expensive but the improvements in life expectancy
                        are not nearly keeping pace. In a study of 71 drugs to treat solid tumors the median improvement
                        in progression free survival was just 2.3 months. Pharmaceutical companies claim that they need the
                        extra income for R&D yet regularly pocket double digit profits greater than the finance industry.
                        The money they do reinvest in the company usually ends up more in marketing budgets than R&D budgets.
                        Pharmacuetical companies, instead, rely on government funding for R&D. The image shown was sent to
                        me by a woman I interviewed for this article. It is for just three weeks of her treatment. While
                        the bottom line indicates that she's only responsible for $17.65, were her husband to loose his employer
                        sponsored insurance, they would be responsible for the entire amount.

                    The fear and stress associated with the financial impacts of the disease affect nearly all patients. Stress is well known
                    to inhibit healing. Employer tied health insurance coupled with skyrocketing costs of medicine lead to
                    a toxic financial situation for patients and their families.
