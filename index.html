                                        Millions of women and their families face this question every day. Do they go into
                                        debt? Do they sell their house? Do they declare bankruptcy?

                                        <br> Karina will survive her bout with cancer. She will recover physically but the cancer
                                        could still come back any time. For a very long time, as long as their insurance
                                        is tied to their jobs, Karina and Tom's careers will be inextricably linked to the
                                        need for health insurance. As long as the ever increasing costs of pharmaceuticals
                                        are passed onto the insurance consumer, Karina and Tom will not likely be able to
                                        afford insurance on the private market. </p>

                                    would allow the the government to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies as one large
                                    block instead of individual health insurers negotiating piecemeal. The government already
                                    negotiates with the pharmaceutical companies through Medicaid but at a much smaller volume.
